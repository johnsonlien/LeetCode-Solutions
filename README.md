## [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

Given a compressed string, i.e. "3[a]2[2[ab]f]", output the decompressed string "aaaababfababf"
Time Complexity: A bit unsure with this but... O(n \* m) where
n = input.length
m = value of number in the input
This seems to be pseudopolynomial time

Space Complexity: O(n \* m) ?

## [654. Maximum Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/)

Given an array of integers, construct a binary tree where the root node is the largest value
